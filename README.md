# Electric-Field-fun-with-matplotlib

## description
I'd always been looking forward to drawing patterns related to the electric field, though little math is involved, my inexperience with computer made this impossible.
Recently, I descovered *matplotlib*, with the help of it, I can draw lines with whatever electric field I want now(in 2 dimension). I worked on it since 8:30 this morning, and finished at around 3 in the afternoon. If I have any more time in the future I think I will do the same in 3 dimension. This package is amazing. Now let me share the code with you. Please install required packages before execution. There are four examples given in the script.
